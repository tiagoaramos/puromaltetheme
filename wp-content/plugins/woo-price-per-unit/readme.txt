WooCommerce Price Per Unit allows the user to show prices recalculated per units(weight) and do some other customization to the appearance of prices

== Description ==

This is an extension for WooCommerce which will help you to sell products where can be important for the customer to know how much a weight unit costs.
For example when selling food. Price is recalculated per weight and then shown according to your liking. The rules can be set store-wide or just for certain products.

**Recalculated price can be shown**

* Instead of original price
* As a new row after original price

You can also add some text after recalculated price for example "/Kg"
Price is recalculated only when the weight is set on the product.

**There are also two different settings depending on viewed page**

* Settings for store page
* Settings for single product page
  
**This plugin can do also some other customization to the appearance of the price**

* Additional custom text for all prices
* You can hide original price when product is on sale
* Additional custom text for variations
* You can hide maximum price for variable products

Plugin is compatible with Woocommerce 2.6.x and 3.0.x

Help me develop this plugin. If you like it please donate some small sum.

**Future releases will bring:**

* Custom recalculation unit - you will be able to set custom number of units(let's say pieces) independent on weight.
* Translation for units text.
* Possibly setting rules to whole categories.
* Custom CSS selector for additional text.  

**There are two sets of settings**

**General settings** - which will affect every product in the store
  It is located under WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products -> Price Per Unit
**Single product settings** - affects just single product, can also override general settings
  It is located in product editor - tab Price Per Unit

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to set recalculation just for one product? =

Yes. You have to go to product editor, tab Price per unit and set an override to the rule you want. It works then even despite the global settings is turned off.

= I have recalculation on, but the price seems untouched. What's wrong?  =

Recalculated price is shown only when the recalculation takes place. That means if you don't have the weight set on the product, nothing happens to the price. Make sure you have weight set.

= I want to use only other features, not recalculation. Is it necessary to have recalculation on?  =

No. Some features are independent on recalculation, you will find them as "General price options" and "Options for variable products" those settings are store wide - they will affect all products.
